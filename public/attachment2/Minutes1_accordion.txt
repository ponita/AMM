<h2><p>General Questions.</p></h2>


<button class="accordion"> &#10148; What is ART?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) is the combination of several antiretroviral medicines used to slow the rate at which HIV multiplies in the body..</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion"> &#10148; When am I supposed to have my first viral load test taken?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>After six months of being on ART.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">&#10148; Why are viral load tests done?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>They are done to monitor the rate at which the viral copies multiply in the body and then appropriate actions are taken.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">&#10148; Who orders VL to be done?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The clinician </p>
</div>

</p>

<div class="panel">
  <p>It is in Butabika directly opposite Butabika Referral Hospital </p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
 <p>&bull; HIV viral load
<p>&bull; EID(early infant diagnosis)</p>
<p>&bull; Sickle cell screening and confirmation</p>
<p>&bull; Hepatitis B surface Antigen</p>

</div>

<button class="accordion">&#10148; Where can I go to provide a sample for testing?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>You can go to the nearest health facility where you were initiated on ART from.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">&#10148; What happens to my sample once I have provided it?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>It is transported from the facility to this Laboratory for testing.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">&#10148; How long does testing typically take before results are availed?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>From reception, EID/ Sickle cell take 3days and viral load takes 2weeks.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">&#10148; How do I interpret results?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>&#9786; when it smiles, it means your viral load is suppressed and you are responding positively to the drug</p>
<p>&#9785; when it is sad, it means your viral load is non suppressing and you are not responding to the drug or you are not taking the drugs appropriately
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">&#10148; Can I get my results online or through a phone call?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>No. Results are only issued by a clinician </p>
